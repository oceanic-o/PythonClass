# The escape sequence is used to escape some of the characters present inside a string.

# Suppose we need to include both a double quote and a single quote inside a string

# str = "He said, "What's the course we are learning?""

print(str)

# double quotes escape
str = "He said, \"What's the course we are learning?\""

# single quotes escape
str = 'He said, "What\'s the course we are learning?"'

print(str)
